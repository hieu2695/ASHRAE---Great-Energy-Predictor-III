Final Project: ASHRAE - Great Energy Predictor III

## Introduction
According to NASA report, the carbon dioxide level was always below 300 parts per million for millennia.

However, since 1950 the level has been rapidly increasing, and reaches approximately 415 parts per million nowadays. One of the main factors to the increase of carbon dioxide level is the energy consumption of industrial buildings. To address the increasing use of energy in industry, significant investments have been made to improve building efficiencies.

However, the challenge is whether the retrofits help to reduce costs and carbon dioxide emissions. A solution is to build a counterfactual machine learning model to forecast the amount of energy consumption for the original building using historic usage rates. The forecasts are compared to the actual energy consumption to calculate the savings after improvements.
